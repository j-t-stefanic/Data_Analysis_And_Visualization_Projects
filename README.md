# Data_Analysis_And_Visualization_Projects
Portfolio of data science projects I have completed for academic, self-learning, and sharing purposes.

Project Statment
Extract NFL Player data from online sources to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Gain insights from the historical player data. As a data analyst, I have followed the below steps to provide conclusions about the data and generate some visualizations of some of the key features.

Steps Followed in this project.
Extracted various CSV files to gather NFL player data.
Imported the CSV files into a Pandas Dataframe.
Performed the Exploratory Data Analysis and data cleansing on the imported data.
Identified the number of features, type of data in each feature, and how the data is spread out. 
Identified any missing or unexpected data, and update or drop columns and/or rows necessary. 
Understand the difference between the Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis.
Decide on key features to focus on for data visualizations.
Use various Python modules such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visualizations.
Formatting visualizations and applying conditional formatting
Used diffrent chart types, slicers, filters and appled design elements.
